The "Image Generator" is a program which will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -- with no repetition and no used colours. Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue component in the range 0..256; It breaks each component into 32 steps -- 8, 16,24, .. 256, which means it will have 32,768 discrete colours. The final image has a size of 256x128px.
